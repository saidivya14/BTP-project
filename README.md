# Topic - Rainfall Prediction on 115years monthly rainfall dataset

# What we did:
  * Filling the missing values using mean
  * Visualise the data with different plots
  * Trained the dataset in the way to take three month values and predict the next month value
  * Apply different ML/CNN models on dataset and calculate MSE,MAE to find best model
